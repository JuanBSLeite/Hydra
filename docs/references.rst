.. [SoA] Structure of arrays or SoA is a layout separating elements of a structure into one parallel array per field. This ease the data manipulation with SIMD instructions and, if only a specific field of the structure is needed, only this field can to be iterated over, allowing more data to fit onto a single cache line. For more information see `Wikipedia SoA page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOS_and_SOA>`_ .

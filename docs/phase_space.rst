Phase-space Monte Carlo
=======================
Phase-Space Monte Carlo simulates the kinematics of a particle with a given four-momentum
decaying to a n-particle final state, without intermediate resonances. Samples 
of phase-space Monte Carlo events are widely used in HEP studies where 
the calculation of phase-space volume is required as well as a starting point to implement and to describe the properties of models with one or more resonances or to simulate the response of the detector to decay's products [James]_. 

Hydra provides an implementation of the Raubold-Lynch method [James]_
and can generate the full kinematics of decays with any number of particles in the final state.
Sequential decays, evaluation of model, production of weighted and unweighted samples and many other features are also supported.
